Our entry for AngelHack 2016 Toronto.

This app was designed to help normal people understand others who have physical and/or mental disabilities. To accomplish this, we present the user with an augmented reality game (using the phone as an interface) through which they experience the various symptoms that would affect everyday actions.

In this app, we simulate tunnel vision, which can result from various causes (e.g. glaucoma). Other ideas we had included dyslexia and autism.
